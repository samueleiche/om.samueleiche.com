This mindfulness app makes sound at intervals to encourage regular breaks and to remind you to pause, breathe and center yourself throughout the day.

## Features

-   A progressive web app (PWA) for desktop and mobile
-   -   installable like an app
-   -   works offline
-   Predefined time interval options
-   Indefinite looping of selected time interval
-   A few settings for user preferences
-   Simple, minimal and meaningful design

#### Limitations

On mobile browsers the app may stop when it is running in the background. This behavior is due to how the device handles background processes and technical limitations inherent to PWA apps. The **[Screen Wake Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API)** helps with this issue by preventing the screen from turning off when the timer is running. Be mindful that having the screen on for long periods can lead to increased battery consumption.
