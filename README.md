## What is Mindfulness?

> Mindfulness is the continuous practice of touching deeply every moment of daily life. To be mindful is to be truly present with your body and your mind, to harmonize your intentions and actions, and to be in harmony with those around you. \
>  â€” Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh

Mindfulness can be practiced at any time, whether we are in the office, kitchen, or bathroom. We can invite mindfulness into our daily activities such as sitting, working, and eating, and so on - with mindful awareness of what we're doing. However, it's not always easy to maintain this, as we can find ourselves lost in front of computer screens. A mindfulness bell programmed to make sound at intervals
can remind us to stop and be present again for a few breaths.

## Features

-   A progressive web app (PWA) for desktop and mobile
-   -   installable like an app
-   -   works offline
-   Predefined time interval options
-   Indefinite looping of selected time interval
-   A few settings for user preferences
-   Simple, minimal and meaningful design

#### Limitations

On mobile browsers the app may stop when it is running in the background. This behavior is due to how the device handles background processes and technical limitations inherent to PWA apps. The **[Screen Wake Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API)** helps with this issue by preventing the screen from turning off when the timer is running. Be mindful that having the screen on for long periods can lead to increased battery consumption.
