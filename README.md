This mindfulness app makes sound at intervals to encourage regular breaks and to remind you to pause, breathe and center yourself throughout the day.

## What is Mindfulness?

> Mindfulness is the continuous practice of touching deeply every moment of daily life. To be mindful is to be truly present with your body and your mind, to harmonize your intentions and actions, and to be in harmony with those around you. \
>  — Thich Nhat Hanh, Zen master

Mindfulness can be practiced at any time, whether we are in the office, kitchen, or bathroom. We can invite mindfulness into our daily activities such as sitting, working, and eating, and so on - with mindful awareness of what we're doing.

More about mindfulness [here](./MINDFULNESS.md).

## How (and Why) to Use the Mindfulness Reminder

> The opposite of mindfulness is forgetfulness. — Thich Nhat Hanh

Taking small moments during the day to connect with the body, and to the present moment, can greatly increase happiness and ease.

Our tendency is to forget that we are in the present moment right now or that we are breathing. It's common to lose awareness while working on computers. Similar to physical exercise, the longer we go without practicing mindfulness, the more challenging it becomes to start again.

> Short moments repeated many times. — Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, from his book "As It Is"

Developing a habit of mindfulness begins with making small, consistent commitments. A short duration of mindful practice guarantees it is authentic. If we force ourselves into longer practices, our minds can become dull or restless, which goes against our original intention.

A bell programmed to make sound at intervals can remind us to stop and be present again when we have been forgetful. In the **Om** app, you can set reminders at intervals that suit you.

Whenever the bell sounds, you can use it as a cue to pause what you are doing and take three mindful breaths, returning to the here and now, reconnecting with your body. Even for only a few moments, you have a chance to check in with yourself. After enjoying a few breaths, you may notice that you have become tense, need to straighten your back, or that you have moved away from your intended task.

## Features

-   A progressive web app (PWA) for desktop and mobile
-   -   installable like an app
-   -   works offline
-   Select a predefined time interval option (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 60 minutes)
-   Indefinite looping of selected time interval
-   A few settings for user preferences
-   Simple, minimal and meaningful design

#### Limitations

On mobile browsers the app may stop when it is running in the background. This behavior is due to how the device handles background processes and technical limitations inherent to PWA apps. The **[Screen Wake Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API)** helps with this issue by preventing the screen from turning off when the timer is running. Be mindful that having the screen on for long periods can lead to increased battery consumption.
